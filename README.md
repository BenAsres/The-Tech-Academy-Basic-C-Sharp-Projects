# The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects

In this repository I have stored some projects I've completed with AOLCC.

Branching Assignment: In this project, I used C-Sharp to create a Package Express system. It takes user input and displays its estimated shipping cost.

Method Class Assignment: For this project, I used C-Sharp and its classes to create a mathematics operation system, relying on user input.

Operators Assignment: This is an employee information system used I created using C-sharp solely focusing on the "operators" aspect of it.

Polymorphism Assignment: I advanced the Operators Assignment Project further with the help of my knowledge of polymorphism.
